# Amazon-Express-User-Exit-Prediction
Deep learning (ANN) project to predict user exit using Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.

# Amazon Express User Exit Prediction

This project predicts **user exit (churn)** using a **Deep Learning model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**.  
The goal is to analyze user behavior and identify whether a user is likely to exit the service.

## 📌 Project Overview
User churn prediction is a key business problem. In this project:
- User data is preprocessed and encoded
- Features are scaled for better model performance
- An ANN model is trained to predict user exit
- Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics

The implementation is done using **Python** in **Google Colab**.
